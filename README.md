# OPS-Capstone

Part of IEEE's 2022 Open Project Space chapter. This capstone project targets the design and operation of a hand-following car utilizng PID control, ultrasonic sensor calibration, and an accumalitive of all knowlegde developed in the project space.

<h3>The Task</h3>
The hand-following car <b>must</b> cease to operate at a certain length from the <em>ultrasonic sensor</em>. The hand-following car <b>must also</b> move dependent on hand location from the <em>ultrasonic sensor</em> given one half of the range is for forward motion and the other is for reverse. The hand-following car must also utilize PID control.
